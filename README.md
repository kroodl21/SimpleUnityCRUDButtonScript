# SimpleUnityCRUDButtonScript
As someone who is not familiar with either Unity or C#, it was not easy to find unity sample file projects that demonstrate the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) fuction activated by a button click. So, I made a simple Unity project you can quickly open up and see how the script connected to buttons works.
